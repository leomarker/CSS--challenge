           <p class="details"> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
        
         <p class="details1"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

  <p class="details second-details">The team was very supportive and kept me <br> motivated</p>

  <p class="details1">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
    for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

          <p class="details-black">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
        
         <p class="details1-black"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
          did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
          could ever have.<br> In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
          experience. It certainly helped me <br> land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
          100% recommend! ”</p>

        <p class="details">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
          learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
   <p class="details1">
    
  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
